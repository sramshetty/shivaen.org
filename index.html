        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <h4 class="Position">NLP Software Engineer</h4>
        <h5>Currently, I work as a software engineer. I graduated from Georgia Tech with a Masters in Computer Science with a focus in Machine/Deep Learning in the fall of 2022. At Georgia Tech, I was a member of the CLAWS
          research group where I collaborated with <a href="https://gaurav22verma.github.io/">Gaurav Verma</a> and was advised by Professor <a href="https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~srijan/">Srijan Kumar</a>. 
          At CLAWS, my research contributions revolved around the robustness of multimodal and NLP models/sytems [<a href="https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-long.890/">Paper</a>].
        </h5>
        <h5>
          Prior to that, I completed my Bachelors in Computer Science at the University of Virginia. During my undergrad I was a student researcher for Professor <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~hw5x/">Hongning Wang</a>,
           where I studied deep learning models based recommendation systems. Specifically, the issues of popularity bias and manners in which one can
          evaluate and debias such models [<a href="https://libraetd.lib.virginia.edu/public_view/7w62f8765">Paper</a>].
        </h5>
        <h5>
          Current Research Interests: Multimodal Learning, Efficent LLMs, and RL
          <br>
          I have previously worked among other researchers at <a href="https://laion.ai/">LAION</a> on open-source AI projects, hoping to advance the science while allowing its capabilities to be used and impact a larger array of people.
          Additionally, when possible I attempt to implement ideas and methods shared in literature to improve my own understanding as well as to potentially help others expand upon the work.
        </h5>
        <h5>
          In my free time I enjoy playing sports/video games, reading papers/books, working out, photography, and learning new things.
